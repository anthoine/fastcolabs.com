<p>I've been using Meteor for the last 3-4 months and for the most part I really like it. There's a big advantage to running the same language on the client and the server, and Meteor takes care of a lot of the housekeeping that you need to do on other platforms like bundling and compressing your javascript and CSS. Guess how many changes you need to make to your code when you rename a file?  Zero! Meteor just takes care of it.</p>
