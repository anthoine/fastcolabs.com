<p>I've been using Meteor for the last few months and for the most part I really like it. There's a big advantage to running the same language on the client and the server, and Meteor takes care of a lot of the housekeeping that you need to do on other platforms like bundling and compressing your Javascript and CSS. But there's one problem: the DB.</p>
